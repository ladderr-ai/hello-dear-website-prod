The Services and Their Limits</h2><p>The Services provide AI-generated telephone conversations, reminders, and messages for older adults and their caregivers. They depend on large language models, speech technologies, and telephony infrastructure supplied by third parties (including OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, LiveKit, Amazon Web Services, telecom carriers, and similar vendors). You acknowledge and agree that:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>AI Outputs are Unreliable:</strong> The Services WILL FREQUENTLY produce incorrect, misleading, offensive, nonsensical, or dangerous content. Large language models hallucinate, confabulate, and generate plausible-sounding but false information. The AI CANNOT be relied upon for accuracy under any circumstances.</li><li><strong>Not Professional Advice:</strong> The Services do not provide medical, legal, mental health, safeguarding, emergency, financial, pharmaceutical, or other professional advice. You must obtain professional support elsewhere and perform your own research before acting on anything the AI says.</li><li><strong>Not a Medical Device:</strong> The Services do not constitute a medical device under UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002. They are not CE marked, FDA approved, or clinically validated. They must not be used as a substitute for medical devices, diagnostic tools, or clinical judgment. We are not obligated to report adverse drug reactions to the MHRA.</li><li><strong>Medication Reminders Are Unverified:</strong> MEDICATION REMINDERS ARE NOT VERIFIED BY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. We do not verify dosages, drug interactions, contraindications, timing, or suitability. The AI may state incorrect medication names, wrong dosages, or dangerous advice. The Services are NOT a substitute for medical devices, alarm systems, pharmacy services, or professional medication management. You must not rely on the Services for critical or time-sensitive medication reminders. Failure to take medication correctly can result in serious injury or death. You use medication reminder features entirely at your own risk and must maintain independent backup systems (such as pill organizers, pharmacy services, or caregiver oversight). If you or a Participant experience any adverse health event that may relate to medication discussed via the Services, YOU must report it via the Yellow Card scheme (yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk) and consult a healthcare professional immediately.</li></ul><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4"><strong>You use the Services entirely at your own risk.</strong> You must independently verify anything the Services say or send, regardless of how plausible it sounds. We do not accept responsibility for any decisions, actions, omissions, injuries, or losses arising from reliance on Service outputs, except to the extent a limitation would be unlawful.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">4. Data You Provide and Participant Consents</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>Legal Authority Required:</strong> You must obtain and document every consent, power of attorney, or other lawful basis required before disclosing personal data or enabling call recording for anyone else (each a "Participant"). If the Participant lacks mental capacity, you must hold valid legal authority (such as a Lasting Power of Attorney, Court of Protection deputyship, or other lawful basis under the Mental Capacity Act 2005) before using the Services on their behalf. You must act in the Participant's best interests at all times.</li><li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> You are solely responsible for explaining the Services, these Terms, and our Privacy Policy to Participants in plain language they can understand. You must inform them that: (a) they will receive AI-generated calls that may contain errors; (b) calls may be recorded; (c) the AI is not a medical professional; (d) they can opt out at any time; and (e) they should call 999 in emergencies.</li><li><strong>Recording Consent (RIPA/PECR Compliance):</strong> You must inform all Participants that calls MAY be recorded BEFORE the call begins. You must obtain their explicit consent to recording where required by law (including the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations). If a Participant does not consent, you must disable recording features. You are solely responsible for compliance with telecommunications and privacy laws. We strongly recommend implementing a verbal recording notice at the start of each call (for example: "This call may be recorded for quality and safety purposes. If you do not consent, please say 'stop recording' now.").</li><li><strong>SMS and Call Consent (PECR):</strong> Before enabling SMS or voice calls to a Participant, you must confirm: (a) They have consented to receive calls/SMS from an automated system; (b) Their number is NOT registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) for marketing purposes, OR you have explicit consent overriding TPS registration; (c) You have explained the nature, frequency, and purpose of communications; (d) You have provided a simple opt-out mechanism. You must not use the Services to send unsolicited marketing. Breach of PECR may result in fines up to £500,000 from the ICO.</li><li><strong>Minimize Data:</strong> Only upload information that is strictly necessary. Avoid sending sensitive health or safeguarding data unless you are legally authorised and it is essential.</li><li><strong>Respect Objections:</strong> If your authority ends, a Participant objects, withdraws consent, or appears distressed by the Service, you must immediately stop using the Services for that Participant and notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">privacy@hellodear.ai</a>.</li><li><strong>Indemnity:</strong> You agree to indemnify us against all claims arising from information you provide or from your failure to obtain lawful authority.</li></ul></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">5. Acceptable Use</h2><p>You must not, and must not allow anyone else to:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>use the Services in breach of law, regulation, telecom rules, or third-party rights;</li><li>harass, exploit, or mislead Participants or any other person;</li><li>attempt to gain unauthorised access, probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system;</li><li>reverse engineer or use the Services to build a competing product;</li><li>use the Services as the sole safeguard or sole reliance in high-risk activities where failure could result in injury, death, or serious damage. You must always maintain independent backup systems, professional oversight, and alternative safety measures.</li></ul><p class="text-sm text-gray-600">We may suspend or terminate access if we believe, in our sole discretion, that your use is unsafe, unlawful, or creates liability for us.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">6. Third-Party Services</h2><p>The Services operate almost entirely through third-party providers. We have no control over their availability, security, or performance. Outages, bugs, or policy changes by those providers may interrupt or degrade the Services without warning. By using the Services you agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms (including those of OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, LiveKit, AWS, payment processors, analytics, and telecom carriers). We may change providers at any time without notice.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">7. Recordings, Transcripts, and Storage</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>Recording Permissions:</strong> Calls may be recorded, transcribed, summarised, or analysed only if you configure the Service to do so and have all required legal permissions. You are responsible for obtaining consent from all parties before recording begins, as required by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and other applicable laws.</li><li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> Recordings, transcripts, or reminders may be lost, corrupted, delivered late, or become inaccessible. We do not guarantee storage, retrieval, accuracy, or availability.</li><li><strong>Backup Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for exporting or backing up any content you need. We may delete data at any time in line with our retention practices.</li><li><strong>Call Data Improvement:</strong> Call recordings, transcripts, and conversation data may be used to improve our AI prompts, product features, and internal analytics. Where technically feasible we aim to prevent this data from being used to train third-party foundation models (such as OpenAI or Anthropic models), but we cannot guarantee this where providers retain data for trust and safety purposes. If you do not consent to this use, do not enable recording features. See Section 11 for licence terms.</li></ul></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">8.

Intellectual Property</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>Our IP:</strong> The Services, including software, voice models, and content, belong to us or our licensors.</li><li><strong>Your Licence:</strong> We grant you a limited, revocable, non-transferable licence to use the Services in accordance with these Terms.</li><li><strong>Your Content:</strong> You retain ownership of content you submit but grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual licence to host, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works for the purpose of operating, improving, and protecting the Services. This includes using call data to improve our AI prompts, fine-tune models, and conduct product development. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to exclude your data from third-party model training by OpenAI, Anthropic, and similar providers, but this cannot be guaranteed where providers retain data for trust and safety, abuse detection, or legal compliance purposes.</li></ul></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">12.

Safeguarding and Welfare Concerns</h2><p>The Services do not provide safeguarding, social care, emergency intervention, or welfare monitoring. We are not qualified to assess welfare risks, abuse, neglect, self-harm, or medical emergencies. You acknowledge and agree that:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>We have no duty of care to Participants beyond providing the technical Services as described.</li><li>The AI cannot reliably detect distress, confusion, safeguarding concerns, or emergencies.</li><li>If you, a Participant, or the AI detect or mention any welfare concern (including abuse, neglect, self-neglect, financial exploitation, coercion, or medical crisis), YOU are solely responsible for contacting appropriate authorities immediately. This includes adult safeguarding teams, local authority social services, NHS services, police, or emergency services (999).</li><li>We may report serious concerns to authorities where we have a legal obligation to do so, but we have no ongoing monitoring, investigation, or intervention responsibilities.</li><li>The Services are not a substitute for social care, mental health support, befriending services, or professional oversight.</li><li><strong>Family Disputes and Claims:</strong> We are not responsible for disputes between you and other family members, caregivers, relatives, or beneficiaries regarding care decisions, use of the Services, inheritance matters, or allegations that you failed in familial or caregiving duties.

Adverse Events and Incident Reporting</h2><p>If the Services cause or contribute to a serious adverse event (including but not limited to injury, hospitalization, medication error, severe distress, safeguarding incident, or death), you must notify us within twenty-four (24) hours at <a href="mailto:safety@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">safety@hellodear.ai</a>.

Disclaimers</h2><p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Services are provided on an "as is", "as available", "with all faults" basis.

Limitation of Liability</h2><p><strong>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any liability that cannot lawfully be excluded or limited under English law. This limitation of liability is fundamental to our ability to offer the Services at the current price point.
