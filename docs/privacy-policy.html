We aim to comply with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018, and, when applicable, the EU GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). This Policy should be read with our <a href="/terms-of-use.html" class="text-teal-900 underline">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="/cookie-policy.html" class="text-teal-900 underline">Cookie Policy</a>.</p><p class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-600">Hello Dear operates as an unincorporated sole trader; no limited company has been formed yet. Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">privacy@hellodear.ai</a> regarding this Policy or data rights.</p></header><div class="space-y-10"><section class="section-card bg-blue-50 border-blue-200"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">1. Summary</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>Controller:</strong> We act as data controller for personal data processed through the Services.</li><li><strong>Third-Party Processing:</strong> The Services run on third-party infrastructure and AI models (including Amazon Web Services for hosting and storage, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, LiveKit, telecom carriers, analytics providers like Google and Meta, and similar vendors). These providers process data on our behalf and may store it outside the UK.</li><li><strong>AI Unreliability:</strong> The Services WILL FREQUENTLY generate incorrect, offensive, or misleading content. We do not independently verify anything the AI systems say and we are not responsible for any harm caused by relying on outputs. <strong>This is NOT an emergency service and cannot dial 999 or detect medical emergencies.</strong></li><li><strong>Your Legal Authority:</strong> You must have lawful authority before supplying information about other people. If the person lacks mental capacity, you must hold a Lasting Power of Attorney, Court of Protection deputyship, or other lawful basis under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. If you cannot demonstrate a lawful basis, do not submit their data.</li><li><strong>Security Limitations:</strong> We cannot guarantee security. We rely on supplier safeguards (primarily AWS managed services) and operational practices appropriate to the scale of our operations, but all storage and transmissions carry risk. Use the Services only if you accept this risk.</li><li><strong>Call Recording:</strong> Calls may be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for quality, safety, and service improvement purposes. You must obtain consent from all parties before enabling recording, as required by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.</li></ul></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">2. Controller and Contact</h2><p>Hello Dear is the controller of personal data collected through the Services. We do not currently appoint an EU representative; if our operations trigger that requirement we will update this Policy. You can contact us at:</p><div class="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6 space-y-2"><p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">privacy@hellodear.ai</a></p><p><strong>Mail:</strong> Postal contact details are available on request via <a href="mailto:privacy@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">privacy@hellodear.ai</a>.</p></div><p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Do not send sensitive information to us by unsecured email. Contact us for alternative arrangements if necessary.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">3. Personal Data We Collect</h2><p>Depending on how you use the Services we may process:</p><div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6"><div><h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-teal-900">Account &amp; Contact Data</h3><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1"><li>Name, email address, phone number, role (for example family member or caregiver), relationship to Participants.</li><li>Account configuration details, support tickets, consent records.</li><li>Basic log information (IP address, timestamps) captured by hosting providers.</li></ul></div><div><h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-teal-900">Participant &amp; Profile Data</h3><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1"><li>Details you provide about the person receiving calls (name, preferred topics, routines, medication names or reminders you enter).</li><li>Relationship notes or escalation instructions that you submit.</li></ul></div><div><h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-teal-900">Communications &amp; Audio</h3><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1"><li>Phone numbers dialled, call duration, timestamps, completion status.</li><li>Audio recordings, transcriptions, summaries, and AI-generated responses when you enable those features.</li><li>SMS or chat content routed through the Services.</li></ul></div><div><h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-teal-900">Technical &amp; Usage Data</h3><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1"><li>Device/browser information supplied by your device, session cookies, analytics identifiers.</li><li>Diagnostic and telemetry data captured by AWS or third-party SDKs.</li></ul></div><div><h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-teal-900">Billing &amp; Commercial Data</h3><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1"><li>Subscription selections, invoices, payment confirmations (processed by Stripe or other payment providers).</li><li>Records needed for fraud prevention, accounting, and tax compliance.</li></ul></div><div><h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-teal-900">Marketing &amp; Cookies</h3><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1"><li>Cookie identifiers, advertising identifiers, referral information, and marketing preferences where you opt in.</li><li>Email engagement metrics (opens, clicks) for newsletters or announcements.</li></ul></div></div><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4"><strong>Special Category Data:</strong> We do not deliberately require special category data (health information, biometric data, etc.), but the nature of the Services means you may choose to submit it. If you choose to submit special category data you are responsible for ensuring you have a lawful basis (explicit consent under UK GDPR Article 9) and the submission is strictly necessary.</p><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4"><strong>Medication Information:</strong> If you enter medication names, dosages, schedules, or health conditions, you are solely responsible for accuracy. We do not review, verify, or validate medication data against medical records, prescriptions, or formularies. AI may misinterpret, misstate, or omit medication information. Do not rely on the Services for critical medication management.</p><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4"><strong>Biometric Voice Data:</strong> Voice recordings may constitute biometric data under UK GDPR Article 9 if used for identification purposes. We do not currently use voice recordings for biometric identification, but our speech synthesis providers (ElevenLabs) may analyze voice characteristics to generate natural-sounding responses. By enabling voice features you consent to this processing where required by law.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">4. Sources of Data</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>Information you submit directly via our dashboard, forms, or support channels.</li><li>Information provided by other Account Holders who invite you or share Participant information.</li><li>Automatically collected information from AWS logs, cookies, analytics tags, and telecom or AI vendors who support the Services.</li><li>Payment status and fraud signals from payment processors.</li></ul></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">5. Lawful Bases for Processing</h2><p>We use the following lawful bases under UK GDPR and EU GDPR:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to create accounts, place calls, generate transcripts, and provide support.</li><li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to secure, maintain, and improve the Services; to investigate abuse; to conduct analytics; to send essential communications; and to promote our Services where the law allows. We balance these interests against your rights.</li><li><strong>Consent</strong> – for non-essential cookies, marketing emails or SMS, optional recording where required, and for processing any special category data you choose to submit.</li><li><strong>Explicit consent (Article 9)</strong> – <strong>Recording of calls containing health information, medication details, or other special category data requires EXPLICIT CONSENT under UK GDPR Article 9.</strong> By enabling call recording features you confirm you have obtained and documented such consent in writing before the first call. Consent for call recording under RIPA 2000 and PECR must also be obtained from all parties to the call before recording begins.</li><li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> – to comply with tax, accounting, regulatory, or law-enforcement requirements.</li><li><strong>Vital interests</strong> – only in rare situations where we reasonably believe it is necessary to protect someone's life or physical safety (for example, if we become aware of an immediate threat of serious harm).</li></ul></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">6. How We Use Personal Data</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>To operate the Services (placing or receiving calls, generating AI dialogue, creating summaries, scheduling reminders).</li><li>To administer accounts, provide customer support, and communicate about Service updates.</li><li>To monitor for abuse, troubleshoot issues, and maintain basic security.</li><li><strong>To test, evaluate, and improve our AI prompts and product experience:</strong> We may review call recordings, transcripts, summaries, or metadata for quality assurance, safety monitoring, prompt engineering, and product development. Call data may be used to improve our AI prompts, fine-tune internal models, and train our systems. Where technically feasible we aim to prevent this data from being used to train third-party foundation models (such as OpenAI or Anthropic base models), but we cannot guarantee this where providers retain data for trust and safety, abuse detection, or legal compliance purposes. Third-party AI providers process call data as processors under our instructions, but may retain limited data for their own safety and policy enforcement purposes as described in their terms.</li><li>To process payments, manage subscriptions, and pursue debt collection where necessary.</li><li>To run analytics and marketing campaigns where lawful.</li><li>To comply with legal obligations, respond to lawful requests from authorities, and enforce our agreements.</li></ul><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">We do not sell personal data. We may create anonymised or aggregated insights that no longer identify individuals for research, product development, or marketing purposes.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">7. Sharing Personal Data</h2><p>We share personal data with:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>Service providers and processors</strong> – including AWS (hosting, storage), OpenAI and Anthropic (LLM inference), ElevenLabs (speech synthesis), LiveKit and telecom carriers (voice routing), payment processors (Stripe), analytics and marketing platforms (Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, Hotjar), email delivery providers, and professional advisers. These suppliers act under contract and process data only on our documented instructions.</li><li><strong>Other users you authorise</strong> – caregivers, relatives, or organisations added to your account.</li><li><strong>Authorities</strong> – if required by law, regulation, court order, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of anyone.</li><li><strong>Business changes</strong> – in the event of a sale, merger, or transfer, provided appropriate protections are in place.</li></ul><p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Once data is shared with a third party acting as independent controller, their privacy practices apply. We are not responsible for their processing outside our instructions.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">8. International Transfers</h2><p>Our providers (especially AWS, AI vendors, and analytics platforms) may process data in countries outside the UK or EEA, including the United States. Where required we rely on recognised safeguards such as the UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, the International Data Transfer Agreement, or adequacy decisions. Copies of relevant safeguards can be requested from <a href="mailto:privacy@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">privacy@hellodear.ai</a> (commercially sensitive information may be redacted).</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">9. Retention</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>Account records and billing data:</strong> Kept while your account is active and for up to six (6) years afterwards to meet legal, tax, and accounting obligations.</li><li><strong>Call recordings and transcripts:</strong> Typically retained for up to one hundred eighty (180) days, unless you request earlier deletion or longer retention (subject to technical feasibility). Deleted data may persist in backups for up to ninety (90) days.</li><li><strong>Analytics, telemetry, and cookie data:</strong> Retained for up to thirteen (13) months.</li><li><strong>Marketing preferences:</strong> Stored until you opt out or close your account.</li><li><strong>Data of deceased Participants:</strong> If a Participant passes away, we will delete their personal data upon written notice from you or their estate representative, subject to our legal obligations (for example, billing records, regulatory compliance). We may retain anonymised or aggregated data. Data of deceased persons may be retained longer where required for legal, regulatory, tax, or billing purposes.</li></ul><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">We may anonymise or aggregate data for longer periods. We are not obligated to retain your information after the applicable retention window. Export anything you need before closing your account. Once deleted, data cannot be recovered.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">10. Security</h2><p>We rely primarily on security controls provided by Amazon Web Services (such as managed databases, encrypted storage, and access controls). Beyond those platform controls we implement operational safeguards appropriate to the nature and scale of our operations (for example, requiring authentication to access dashboards, using secure connections, and limiting data access to necessary personnel). Like all online services, we cannot guarantee protection against unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, or data breaches affecting us or our suppliers.</p><p class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-600">You accept these inherent risks and are responsible for your own device security, account credentials, and for monitoring your account for suspicious activity. If you suspect unauthorized access or a data breach, contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:security@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">security@hellodear.ai</a>.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">11. Your Responsibilities</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li><strong>Legal Authority:</strong> Only provide information you are legally permitted to share. If a Participant lacks mental capacity, you must hold a Lasting Power of Attorney, Court of Protection deputyship, or other lawful authority under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 before submitting their data.</li><li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Explain the Services and this Policy to Participants in plain language they can understand. Inform them that: (a) calls may be recorded; (b) AI may make errors; (c) this is not a medical service; (d) they should call 999 in emergencies; and (e) they can opt out at any time.</li><li><strong>Recording Consent:</strong> Obtain explicit consent from all parties before enabling call recording, as required by RIPA 2000 and PECR. For calls involving health information, obtain explicit Article 9 consent in writing.</li><li><strong>Respect Choices:</strong> Respect any withdrawal of consent, objection, or distress expressed by Participants. Stop using the Services for that Participant immediately and notify us.</li><li><strong>Verify AI Outputs:</strong> Review AI outputs before acting. Never rely on AI for medication dosages, medical advice, financial decisions, legal matters, or safeguarding concerns. Consult qualified professionals.</li><li><strong>Report Security Issues:</strong> Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access, misuse of data, or security breaches.</li><li><strong>Report Adverse Events:</strong> If the Services contribute to a serious adverse event (injury, medication error, hospitalization, or death), notify us within 24 hours at <a href="mailto:safety@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">safety@hellodear.ai</a>.</li></ul><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">We are not responsible for any losses, claims, regulatory fines, or legal action caused by your failure to meet these responsibilities.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">12. Your Rights</h2><p>You may have the following rights under data protection law:</p><ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2"><li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li><li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li><li>Request deletion where there is no lawful reason for us to continue processing.</li><li>Object to or request restriction of processing, including profiling, when we rely on legitimate interests.</li><li>Receive a copy of data you provided in a portable format or ask us to transfer it to another controller where technically feasible.</li><li>Withdraw consent at any time (processing already performed remains lawful).</li><li>Lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (<a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/" class="text-teal-900 underline">ico.org.uk/concerns</a>) or with your local regulator.</li></ul><p>To exercise any right email <a href="mailto:privacy@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">privacy@hellodear.ai</a>. We may ask for proof of identity. We aim to respond within one month; complex requests may take longer as permitted by law.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">13. Children and Safeguarding</h2><p>The Services are directed at adults configuring support for older adults. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13 (or any higher local age threshold). If you believe a child has provided data without appropriate authority, contact us so we can delete it. You must ensure appropriate safeguards and legal bases are in place when Participants are vulnerable or lack capacity.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">14. Automated Decisions and AI Behaviour</h2><p>AI models generate conversational content and reminders automatically. We do not use them to make legally or similarly significant decisions. AI behaviour is unpredictable and may produce incorrect, biased, or offensive statements. You must treat outputs as unverified and are solely responsible for any actions based on them.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">15. Marketing Communications</h2><p>We may send service notices that you cannot opt out of (for example, security alerts). Marketing emails or SMS are sent only where we have consent or another lawful basis. You can unsubscribe at any time via the communication or by contacting us.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">16. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2><p>We use cookies, pixels, SDKs, and similar technologies for essential functionality, analytics, and advertising. Details of the tools we use and how to manage preferences are provided in our <a href="/cookie-policy.html" class="text-teal-900 underline">Cookie Policy</a>. Blocking cookies may limit functionality.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">17. Changes</h2><p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in law, technology, or our practices. When we do, we will post the revised Policy with a new "Last Updated" date and, where required, provide additional notice. Continued use of the Services after the effective date means you accept the revised Policy.</p></section><section class="section-card"><h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-teal-900">18. Questions or Complaints</h2><p>If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, contact <a href="mailto:privacy@hellodear.ai" class="text-teal-900 underline">privacy@hellodear.ai</a>.
